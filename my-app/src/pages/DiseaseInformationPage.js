            The term 'dementia' and 'Alzheimer's disease' do not have the same meaning. Dementia is an umbrella term describing a syndrome associated with more than 100 different diseases affecting the brain (Alzheimer's disease is one of them)
            </li>
            <li>
            The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (approximately 50-70 per cent of all dementia cases)
            </li>
            <li>
            Dementia was the third leading cause of death in Australia in 2010
            </li>
            <li>
            298,000 Australians and 35,600,000 individuals worldwide live with dementia, which is approximately 1 per cent of the Australian population and 0.5 per cent of the global population
            </li>
            <li>
            The prevalence of dementia is projected to reach 900,000 by 2050
            </li>
            <li>
            Generally, dementia is associated with a loss of mental or cognitive function
            </li>
            <li>
            Adults younger than 65 years old may also develop dementia
            </li>
            <li>
            Reduction in risk factors and increase in protective factors may reduce chance of developing dementia
            </li>
            <li>
            A 10 - 25 per cent reduction in risk factors can potentially prevent as many as 1.1 - 3.0 million cases worldwide.
